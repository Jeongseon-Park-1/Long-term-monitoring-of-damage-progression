# Long-term Monitoring of Damage Progression

This repository provides a research-oriented implementation for long-term monitoring of surface damage progression on bridges using temporal UAV images.
The workflow integrates hierarchical localization, structure-from-motion (SfM), and YOLOv8-based damage segmentation to enable consistent damage identification and tracking across different inspection times.



## Overview

The proposed framework aims to localize and quantify surface damage progression by aligning UAV images captured at different times into a common spatial reference.
The key components of the pipeline are:

1. YOLOv8-based damage segmentation for identifying surface damage regions such as cracks, spalling, and water leakage
2. COLMAP-based SfM for geometric reconstruction and spatial consistency
3. Hierarchical localization (hloc) for robust camera pose estimation under appearance changes

This repository focuses on providing code, configuration files, and representative sample images.

## Methods Overview

### Damage Segmentation (YOLOv8)

Surface damage regions are identified using a **YOLOv8-based instance segmentation model** trained to detect damage types commonly observed on concrete bridge surfaces.

- **Model**: YOLOv8-seg  
- **Damage types**: crack, spalling, water leakage  
- **Output**: pixel-wise segmentation masks

### Structure-from-Motion (COLMAP)

**COLMAP** is used to reconstruct the 3D geometry of the bridge and to maintain spatial consistency between UAV images captured at different inspection times.

The reconstructed SfM model provides:
- Camera poses  
- Sparse point clouds  
- A shared reference frame for damage comparison

### Hierarchical Localization

To achieve robust camera pose estimation across long-term inspections with significant appearance changes, **hierarchical localization (hloc)** is employed.

The localization pipeline integrates:
- Global image retrieval  
- Local feature matching  
- Geometric verification  

This approach enables reliable localization under varying illumination, viewpoint, and surface conditions.

## Dataset Availability

The UAV images used in this study were captured from an operational prestressed concrete girder bridge at multiple inspection times.  
Only representative samples are included in this repository due to size limitations.
